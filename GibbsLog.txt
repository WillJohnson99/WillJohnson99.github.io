Changelog

v1.0.2
- Fixed a small error I made in the Meta.ini file that caused the mod to have problems with decompiling. Credit goes to forum user SomeoneIKnow and Developer
Jake Andreoli (Aerhx) for pointing this out!

v1.0.1
- Hello! Right now, you have the first edition (v1.0.1) of the Jimmy Gibbs Jr. mod, meaning that changes made later to it will be released in future updates, 
and said changes will be noted inside of this changelog. If you want to see what the mod has to offer, read the readme.txt file located inside this .zip.
